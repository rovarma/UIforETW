// This class encapsulates running a child thread and reading
// its output. Typical usage is:
//   ChildProcess child(fullPathToExecutable);
//   std::string args = _T(" -go");
//   child.Run(bShowCommands_, _T("exename.exe") + args);
// Run returns immediately. The destructor, GetExitCode(), and
// GetOutput() will all wait for the process to exit. The
// destructor and GetExitCode() both print all output as it
// arrives using the global outputPrintf function, whereas
// GetOutput returns the output.
